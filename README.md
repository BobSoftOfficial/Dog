# Dog
Dog is an small esoteric language made in lua.
So to use it first install lua https://lua.org/
Then download the dog.lua file.
Then make another file and call it for example main.dog

# Tutoriol
Dog only has 1 valid command, dog
This is how to use it 

```
<any value1>
dog
<any value2>
<any value3>
```

it will put anyvalue1 + anyvalue2 in an storige called store

then it will chechk if store equals 1 if so it will print the assci character you put in on anyvalue3

If store is 2 it will jump to the line number you put in on anyvalue3

If store is 3 it will take your input, reset the program and put your input in the first line of the program

If store is 4 then it will break the program

If store is 5 then store becomes the next line minus the first line

If store is 6 then the line before dog becomes the line after

If it is not 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 or 6 it will print store.

Every command in dog if it is a number or not it needs to be on a new line, it will ignore everything that has nothing to do with the dog command.
And you cant put any text before or after a command.
