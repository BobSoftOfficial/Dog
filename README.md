Dog only has 1 valid command, dog
This is how to use it 

```
<any value1>
dog
<any value2>
<any value3>
```

it will put anyvalue1 + anyvalue2 in an storige called store, then it will chech if store equals 1 if so it will print the assci character you put in on anyvalue3

If store is 2 it will jump to the line number you put in on anyvalue3

If store is 3 it will take your input, reset the program and put your input in the first line of the program

If it is not 1 or 2 or 3 it will print store.
